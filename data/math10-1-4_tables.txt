and a x + b y + c = 0

In fact, the converse is also true for any pair of lines. You can verify them by
considering some more examples by yourself.
Let us now consider some more examples to illustrate it.

Plot the points A(0, 2), B(6, 0),
P(0, – 4) and Q(3, – 2) on graph
paper, and join the points to form the
lines AB and PQ as shown in
Fig. 3.1.
We observe that there is a point
B (6, 0) common to both the lines
AB and PQ. So, the solution of the
pair of linear equations is x = 6 and
y = 0, i.e., the given pair of equations
is consistent.

Example 2 : Graphically, find whether the following pair of equations has no solution,
unique solution or infinitely many solutions:
5x – 8y + 1 = 0 (1)

3x – y + = 0 (2)

,
Solution : Multiplying Equation (2) by we get
3
5x – 8y + 1 = 0
But, this is the same as Equation (1). Hence the lines represented by Equations (1)
and (2) are coincident. Therefore, Equations (1) and (2) have infinitely many solutions.
Plot few points on the graph and verify it yourself.
